description: I am Wenqi Olivia Di (狄文绮), a senior-year undergraduate student majoring in Biomedical Engineering at Hajim School of Engineering (Alpha Eta Mu Beta BME National Honor Society ’24), with a dual degree in Economics at the School of Arts & Sciences, University of Rochester. My research interests lie broadly in biomechanics and synthetic biology, especially topics related to biomaterials, pathology, and machinery design. I have worked on several projects centered around developing algorithms and hardwares for various projects not only for research but also for machine manufacturing, including investigating material properties of synthetic cartilage (Abstract accepted into BMES Annual Conference 2023), and co-culture dual-channel 3D bioprinting system, and developed a new excel system for helping organize clinical trial information at Good Clinical Practice Office at Changzhou No.2 People’s Hospital. Besides research, I have been actively participating in Machine Manufacturing and Business Analysis. See my CV for more details and selected awards in iGEM, National Academy of Engineers, and fellowships.
