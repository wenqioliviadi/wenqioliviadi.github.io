- **Hi! I am Wenqi!** I have worked on several projects centered around developing **algorithms and hardware** for various projects not only for research but also for machine manufacturing, including **investigating material properties of synthetic cartilage** (abstract accepted into BMES Annual Conference 2023 for my independent research), and **co-culture dual-channel 3D bioprinting system**, and developed a new excel system for helping organize clinical trial information at **Good Clinical Practice (GCP)** Office at Changzhou No.2 People’s Hospital.
- Besides research, I have been actively participating in **machine fabrication and business analysis**. See my CV for more details and selected awards in iGEM, National Academy of Engineers, and fellowships.

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
