- Participated in the Grand Jamboree in Paris, France, the world's largest synthetic biology competition, representing the 2023 Rochester team.
- Policy & Practice Manager, Entrepreneurship Team Lead, and member of the Wet Lab and Hardware sub-teams, with guidance from advisors Dr. Anne Meyer, Dr. Nancy Chen, Dr. Alexis Stein, and three PhD TAs due to the independent research nature of the project.
- Deep gratitude to the generous sponsors for supporting the research endeavors, the experts in the field for their invaluable insights, and the Rochester community for their enthusiasm and shared passion for synthetic biology.

#### Personal Contribution: 
- Developed objective strategy for researching potential customers and collaborators and brainstorming strategies to improve the projects via different angles. 
- Networking and conducting customer discoveries through various social media and platforms. This novel approach led to better characterization of the underlying problems with different stages of the project (brainstorming, development, and project implementation). The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new applications of the 3D bioprinter developed.
